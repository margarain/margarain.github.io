								<strong>Elora Chin Valencia</strong> grew up in a toxic Christian family where she was
								viewed as the black sheep. Araw-araw ay ipinaparamdam sa kanya ng mundo na wala siyang
								lugar sa sarili niyang tahanan. She was a consistent dean's lister and an obedient
								daughter, which left her wondering what she had done so wrong to be disregarded as a
								speck of dust in the wind. They made her feel like she was just dirt, filling up the
								empty space. The one who would never have her own safe place.
							</p>

							<p>
								Feeling all of this contributed to her endless suicidal ideations.

								Baka nga tama sila. Baka nga wala siyang halaga at kailanman ay hindi na sasaya.

								She almost believed that. She almost held onto that notion.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not until she met the man in his BS Civil Engineering uniform and gorgeous grin,
								<strong>Troy Jefferson Dela Paz</strong>. He kissed her forehead, and her loud thoughts
								were silenced. Her demons calmed down. Her foes were defeated.

								For the first time in her life, she had proven her family wrong—a happy Elora Chin was
								possible. She was loved and well-taken care of. Troy embraced her sharp parts, not
								minding the wounds he might get.

								But fate had a lot of cruel things in store for her.

								Because when she thought she had reached the peak of happiness, she found herself
								drowning alone in the ocean she now called home, alone in her shame, alone with the
								waves she couldn't tame.
